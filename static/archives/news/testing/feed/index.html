										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ubuntu release team <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-October/004615.html">have announced</a> a 1st test ISO RC build for all 18.10 flavours. </p>
<p>Please help us test these and subsequent RC builds, so that we can have an amazing and well tested release in the coming week.</p>
<p><strong>As noted below, the initial builds will NOT be the final ones.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>Over the next few hours, builds will start popping on the Cosmic Final
milestone page[1] on the ISO tracker.  These builds are not final.
We're still waiting on a few more fixes, a few things to migrate, etc.
I've intentionally not updated base-files or the ISO labels to reflect
the release status (so please don't file bugs about those).

What there are, however, are "close enough" for people to be testing in
anger, filing bugs, fixing bugs, iterating image builds, and testing
all over again.  So, please, don't wait until Wednesday night to test,
testing just before release is TOO LATE to get anything fixed.  Get out
there, grab your favourite ISO, beat it up, report bugs, escalate bugs,
get things fixed, respin (if you're a flavour lead with access), and
test, test... And test.  Did I mention testing?  Please[2] test.

Thanks,

... Adam

</blockquote>
<p>Downloads for RC builds can be found by following the <img src="//kubuntu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/d9e1/cdrom.png" /> link after clicking through to &#8216;Cosmic Final&#8217; on the  <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/">Ubuntu ISO tracker</a>. Please report test case results if you have a Ubuntu SSO account (or are prepared to make one). Feedback can also be given via our normal email lists, IRC, forums etc.</p>
<p>Upgrade testing from 18.04 in installed systems (VM or otherwise) is also a very useful way to help prepare for the new release. <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CosmicUpgrades/Kubuntu">Instructions for upgrade</a> can be found on the Ubuntu help wiki.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from yesterday&#8217;s 1st spin of the 17.10 RC images by the ubuntu release team, today the RC images (marked Artful Final on the QA tracker) have been re-spun and updated.</p>
<p>Please update your ISOs if you downloaded previous images, and test as before.</p>
<p>Please help us by testing as much as you have time for. Remember, in particular we need i386 testers, on &#8220;bare metal&#8221; rather than VMs if possible.</p>
<p>Builds are available from:</p>
<p><a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/383/builds">http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/383/builds</a></p>

<p>Take note of the Ubuntu Community ISO testing party on Monday 16th at 15:00 UTC:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-17-10-community-iso-testing/458">https://community.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-17-10-community-iso-testing/458</a></p>
<p>Please attend and participate if you are able. The #ubuntu-on-air IRC channel on irc.freenode.net can be joined via a web client found beneath the live stream on <a href="http://ubuntuonair.com">ubuntuonair.com</a>, or of course you can join in a normal IRC client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artful Aardvark (17.10) initial Release Candidate (RC) images are now available for testing. Help us make 17.10 the best release yet!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Note: This is an initial spin of the RC images. It is likely that at least one more rebuild will be done on Monday.</strong></span></p>
<p>Adam Conrad from the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2017-October/004224.html">Ubuntu release team list</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, I spun up a set of images for everyone with serial 20171015.</p>
<p>Those images are *not* final images (ISO volid and base-files are still<br />
not set to their final values), intentionally, as we had some hiccups<br />
with langpack uploads that are landing just now.</p>
<p>That said, we need as much testing as possible, bugs reported (and, if<br />
you can, fixed), so we can turn around and have slightly more final<br />
images produced on Monday morning. If we get no testing, we get no<br />
fixing, so no time like the present to go bug-hunting.</p>
<p>&#8230; Adam</p></blockquote>
<p>The Kubuntu team will be releasing 17.10 on October 19, 2017.</p>
<p>This is an initial pre-release. Kubuntu RC pre-releases are NOT recommended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues</li>
<li>Anyone who needs a stable system</li>
<li>Anyone uncomfortable running a possibly frequently broken system</li>
<li>Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable</li>
</ul>
<p>Kubuntu pre-releases are recommended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs</li>
<li>Kubuntu, KDE, and Qt developers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting Kubuntu 17.10 Intial Release Candidate</strong>:</p>
<p>To upgrade to Kubuntu 17.10 pre-releases from 17.04, run</p>
<p><em>sudo do-release-upgrade -d</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we missed by a whisker getting updated PIM (kontact, kmail, akregator, kgpg etc..) into Zesty for release day, and we believe it is important that our users have access to this significant update, packages are now available for testers in the Kubuntu backports landing ppa.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3176" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/43cb/kontact.png" alt="" width="650" height="442" /></p>
<p>While we believe these packages should be relatively issue-free, please bear in mind that they have not been tested as comprehensively as those in the main ubuntu archive.</p>
<p>Testers should be prepared to troubleshoot and hopefully report issues that may occur. Please provide feedback on our mailing list [1], IRC [2], or optionally via social media.</p>
<p>After a period of testing and verification, we hope to move this update to the main backports ppa.</p>
<p><strong>You should have some command line knowledge before testing.</strong><br />
<strong>Reading about how to use <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed">ppa purge</a> is also advisable.</strong></p>
<p>How to test KDE PIM 16.12.3 for Zesty:</p>
<p>Testing packages are currently in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/backports-landing">Kubuntu Backports Landing PPA</a>.</p>
<p><em>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-landing</em><br />
<em>sudo apt-get update</em><br />
<em>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</em></p>
<p>1. Kubuntu-devel mailing list: <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kubuntu-devel">https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kubuntu-devel</a><br />
