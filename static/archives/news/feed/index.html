<p>Greetings, Kubuntu Community!</p>



<p>Today marked an important Kubuntu Council meeting, where we witnessed significant progress and collaboration among our esteemed council members &#8211; Darin Miller, Rik Mills, Valorie Zimmerman, Aaron Honeycutt, Jonathan Riddell (Kubuntu Treasurer), and Simon Quigley(Lubuntu). In this blog post, we’re excited to share the highlights and outcomes of the discussions that took place.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Focus on the Upcoming Kubuntu LTS Release 24.04</strong><br><br>A primary focus of our meeting was setting the objectives for the imminent Kubuntu LTS release. The council engaged in in-depth discussions to ensure that the upcoming release meets the high expectations of our community and continues the Kubuntu legacy of excellence.<br></li><li><strong>Ubuntu Flavours Statement of LTS Support</strong><br><br>Understanding the importance of clear communication, we considered the necessity of a statement regarding Long-Term Support (LTS) required by <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors">Ubuntu recognised flavours</a>. This move aligns with our commitment to provide transparency and detailed information to our users.<br></li><li><strong>Exciting Collaboration with Scarlett Gately Moore</strong><br><br>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce that we have agreed to contract <a href="https://www.scarlettgatelymoore.dev/">Scarlett Gately Moore</a> for a three-month period. With a preliminary budget allocated, Scarlett will play a crucial role in delivering key projects:-<br><br>  &#8211; The 24.04 LTS Release,<br>  &#8211; Updating the Kubuntu Installer to Calamares,<br>  &#8211; Preparing an Alpha of Plasma 6 targeting the 24.10 release.<br><br>This decision was unanimously agreed upon and reflects our dedication to continually enhancing Kubuntu.</li></ol>



<h2>Actions Moving Forward:</h2>



<p><strong>Coordination and Oversight:</strong> Simon Quigley will be coordinating with Rik Mills and Scarlett Moore, managing the intricate details and ensuring the smooth delivery of our objectives.</p>



<p><strong>Financial Processes:</strong> Simon Quigley will oversee the invoicing process with Scarlett Moore, following the agreed pro-forma. Jonathan Riddell, our Kubuntu Treasurer, will handle the commissioning of payments.</p>



<p><strong>Communication and Documentation:</strong> As a part of our commitment to keep the community informed, I, Rick Timmis, will be updating the Kubuntu Council mailing list about the meeting&#8217;s outcomes. Additionally, I will draft an LTS Statement for submission to the Ubuntu Technical Board, detailing our approach and commitment to Kubuntu&#8217;s Long-Term Support.</p>



<p>This meeting was a testament to the dedication and passion of our council members and the broader Kubuntu community. We&#8217;re excited about the direction in which Kubuntu is heading and are eager to see the fruition of these projects.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for your continued support of Kubuntu!</p>



<p>Closing:</p>



<p>Best Regards,</p>



<p>Rick Timmis<br>Kubuntu Council<br></p>

<p>We have had many requests to make Plasma 5.27 available in our backports PPA for Jammy Jellyfish 22.04. However, for technical reasons this would have broken upgrades to Kinetic 22.10 while that upgrade path existed. Now that Kinetic is end of life, it is possible to allow opt in backports of plasma 5.27 for 22.04.</p>



<p>As with the previous backport of plasma 5.25, 5.27 is provided in the backports-extra PPA</p>



<p>This PPA is intended to be used in combination with our standard backports PPA, but should also work standalone.</p>



<p>As usual with our PPAs, there is the caveat that the PPA may receive additional updates and new releases of KDE Plasma, Gear (Apps) and Frameworks, plus other apps and required libraries. Users should always review proposed updates to decide whether they wish to receive them.</p>



<p><em>While we feel these backports will be beneficial to enthusiastic adopters, users wanting to use a more tested Plasma release on the 22.04 base may find it advisable to stay with Plasma 5.24 as included in the original 22.04 (Jammy) release.</em></p>



<p>To add the PPA and upgrade, do:</p>



<p><em>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</em></p>



<p>We hope keen adopters enjoy using Plasma 5.27</p>



<p></p>

<p>The beta of Kubuntu Lunar Lobster (to become 23.04 in April) has now been released, and is available for <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/23.04/beta/">download</a>.</p>



<p>This milestone features images for Kubuntu and other Ubuntu flavours.</p>



<p>Pre-releases of Kubuntu Lunar Lobster are not recommended for:</p>



<ul><li>Anyone needing a stable system</li><li>Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues</li><li>Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable</li></ul>



<p>They are, however, recommended for:</p>



<ul><li>Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs</li><li>Kubuntu, KDE, and Qt developers</li><li>Other Ubuntu flavour developers</li></ul>



<p>The Beta includes some software updates that are ready for broader testing. However, it is an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs.</p>



<p><strong>We STRONGLY advise testers to read the </strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LunarLobster/Beta/Kubuntu"><strong>Kubuntu 23.04 Beta release notes</strong></a><strong> before installing, and in particular the section on &#8216;</strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LunarLobster/Beta/Kubuntu#Known_issues"><strong>Known issues</strong></a><strong>&#8216;.</strong></p>



<p>Kubuntu took part in ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from March 2nd to March 9th. Details for all flavours are available on the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-23-04-testing-week/34246">Ubuntu Discourse announcement</a>.</p>



<p>You can also find more information about the entire 23.04 release (base, kernel, graphics etc) in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-notes/31910">main Ubuntu Beta release notes</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2023-March/000288.html">announcement.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>To enable Flatpaks in KDE’s Discover in Kubuntu 23.04, run this command:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt install flatpak plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</code><br></p>



<p>To enable the largest Flatpak repository, run this command:</p>



<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo<br></code></p>



<p>Log out and log back in (or restart) to re-initialize the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable, otherwise, newly installed Flatpak apps will not run or appear in the startup menu.</p>

<p>Kubuntu is and has always been &#8220;Ubuntu&#8221; combined with the greatest software from the KDE Community. Prior to 23.04 and aligned with Debian packaging, Flatpak and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snap</a> package sources were included as installable options with each source requiring its own set of commands and repositories. However, enabling both sources caused confusion with new users (and *Ubuntu support groups) as the user was unsure about several issues including which or how their packages were installed; the proper place to report issues; and/or how to remove them. As a result, Canonical, Ubuntu&#8217;s parent company, and the Ubuntu Technical Board have chosen to support Snaps only upon initial install.</p>



<p>User and community member, arraybolt3, provides more <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/9">details</a> regarding challenges of Flatpak support.</p>



<p>No worries; Flatpaks are still available for all Ubuntu flavors. To enable Flatpaks in KDE&#8217;s Discover in Kubuntu 23.04, run this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install flatpak plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</code></pre>



<p>To enable the largest Flatpak repository, run this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo</code></pre>



<p>Log out and log back in (or restart) to re-initialize  the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable, otherwise, newly installed Flatpak apps will not run or appear in the startup menu. </p>
