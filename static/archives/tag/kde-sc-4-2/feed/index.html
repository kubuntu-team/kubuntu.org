<!--break--></p>
<h3>Jaunty (current development release)</h3>
<p>Packages for Jaunty (current development release) are available.  If you use Jaunty you will be able to upgrade as normal.</p>
<h3>8.10 (Intrepid)</h3>
<p>Packages for Kubuntu 8.10 can be installed by following the instructions below.</p>
<p><em>Note: These packages are not supported by Canonical; for a stable system it is not recommended to upgrade. KDE 4.2 will be officially supported as part of Kubuntu 9.04 being released April 23rd 2009.</em></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>The updated packages for Kubuntu 8.10 are in the kubuntu-members-kde4 PPA. To update to KDE 4.2, please follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Remove the koffice-data-kde4 package if you have it installed. The current koffice2 packages in the kubuntu-members-kde4 PPA are incompatible with the KDE 4.2 packages since they try to install icons to the same locations.</li>
<li>
Follow the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Kubuntu">Kubuntu Repository Guide</a> to enable <em>Recommended Updates</em> and <em>Unsupported Updates</em>.
</li>
<li>
In <em>Third Party Software</em> add:<br />
<em>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-members-kde4/ppa/ubuntu intrepid main</em>
</li>
<li>
Old Plasma packages are not compatible with KDE 4.2, you should uninstall any plasmoids.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
You can now update any existing KDE 4 installation to 4.2 with Full Upgrade in the package manager, or using the Adept Updater tool in your system tray.
</li>
<li>
Now log out. When you log in you will have KDE 4.2. Enjoy.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>KDE 4.2.2 uses Akonadi which will install MySQL.  The MySQL packages in intrepid will ask for a password, you can set this to anything you like.</p>
<p>Digikam will not install alongside these packages due to conflicting library versions.</p>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>If you come across any issue which may be packaging related, it is recommended that you join the Kubuntu IRC channel (#kubuntu on irc.freenode.net) and query those in the channel for assistance.
</p>
<p>Thanks to Steve, Jonathan, Nathan, Roderick and awen for these packages.  </p>
<p>If you want to see your name above, then join the Kubuntu Team.<br />

Some of your plasmoids from KDE 4.1 may be incompatible with KDE 4.2 (and will be removed during the upgrade).

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The updated packages for Kubuntu 8.10 are located in the Kubuntu Experimental Software Personal Package Archive (PPA) repository. To update to KDE 4.1.80 (4.2 beta1), please follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the koffice-data-kde4 package. The current koffice2 packages are incompatible with the KDE 4.2 packages since they try to install icons to the same places.</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Kubuntu">Kubuntu Repository Guide</a> to enable <em>Recommended Updates</em> and add the following to your &#8216;Third-Party Software&#8217; tab:
<div style="border: 1px solid #dae9fd; background-color: #eff5fc; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-experimental/ubuntu intrepid main</div>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">You can now update any existing KDE 4 installation to the most recent version using the Adept Updater tool in your system tray.</li>
<li>Now log out and press Alt + E to restart X. When you log in you will have KDE 4.2 Beta 1. Enjoy.</li>
</ol>
