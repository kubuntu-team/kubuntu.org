										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kubuntu 21.04 Testing Week</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re delighted to announce that we&#8217;re participating in another ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from April 1st to April 7th with other flavours in the Ubuntu family. On April 1st, the beta version of Kubuntu 21.04 ‘Hirsute Hippo’ will be released after freezing all new changes to its features, user interface, and documentation. Between April 1st and the final release on April 22nd, all efforts by the Kubuntu team and community should be focused on ISO testing, reporting bugs, fixing bugs, and translations right up to final release.</p>
<p>On social media, please use the #UbuntuTestingWeek hashtag if you write about your testing or want to spread the word about the event to your followers. Testers can visit the <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/">ISO tracker</a> and read <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs">bug reporting tutorials</a>.</p>
<p>You can test without changing your system by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine) with software like VMWare Player, VirtualBox (apt install). Or run Hirsute from USB, SD Card, or DVD to test on your hardware.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways that you can help test the release, including trying out the various live session and installation test cases from the ISO tracker. If you find a bug, you’ll need a Launchpad account to file it against the package the app is bundled in, which you can find by asking around on the IRC/Telegram/Matrix Kubuntu channels or the user mail list.</p>
<p>Chat live in IRC (Freenode) #ubuntu-quality (or #kubuntu-devel if it cannot be reproduced on other flavours) or Telegram: Ubuntu Testers.</p>
<p>The easiest and fastest way to file a bug is in the command line (Konsole): ubuntu-bug $packagename, such as ubiquity &#8211; `ubuntu-bug ubiquity`</p>
<p>It is important to file the bug within the testing environment so that the necessary results are properly provided to the bug-tracker. All you need to provide to the ISO tracker is the bug number.</p>
<p>If the bug is found in the installer, file it against `ubiquity`, or file it against the `linux` if your hardware isn’t working. We encourage those that are willing, to install it either in a VM or on physical hardware. It requires at least 15GB of hard drive space. If you can use it for a few days, more bugs can be discovered and reported.</p>
<p>Please test apps that you regularly use, so you can identify bugs and regressions that should be reported, especially as the recently released Plasma 5.21.3 is bundled in this release. <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/419/builds">New ISO files</a> are built every day, and you should always test with the most up-to-date ISO. It is easier and faster to update an existing daily ISO file on Linux with the command below. Run in the terminal or konsole from within the folder with the ISO file:</p>
<p>$ zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/hirsute-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync</p>
<p>We look forward to you joining us to make Kubuntu 21.04 an even bigger success, and hope that you will also test out the other Ubuntu <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/series/71/manifest">flavours</a>.</p>

<p>We are preparing Kubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04 LTS) for distribution on April 21, 2016. With this Beta 2 pre-release, you can see what we are trying out in preparation for our next stable version. We would love to get some testing by our users. </p>
<p>Plasma 5, the next generation of KDE&#8217;s desktop has been rewritten to make it smoother to use while retaining the familiar setup. The fifth set of updates to Plasma 5 is the default in this version of Kubuntu. Plasma 5.6 should be available in backports soon after release of the LTS. </p>
<p>Kubuntu comes with KDE Applications 15.12 containing all your favorite apps from KDE, including Dolphin. Even more applications have been ported to KDE Frameworks 5 but those which aren&#8217;t should fit in seamlessly.  Non-KDE applications include LibreOffice 5.1 and Firefox 45.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/Beta2/Kubuntu">Release Notes</a> for more details, where to download, and known problems. We welcome help to fix those final issues; please join the Kubuntu-Devel mail list[1], just hop into #kubuntu-devel on freenode to connect with us.</p>
