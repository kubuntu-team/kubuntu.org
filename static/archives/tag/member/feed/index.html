										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at 9:35PM UTC the Kubuntu Council approved Clive Johnston&#8217;s application for becoming a Kubuntu Member.</p>
<p>Clive has been around for a while now, helping Scarlett and Philip with the packaging and continuous integration, and his efforts have already made a huge difference.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet of his interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;ovidiu-florin&gt; clivejo: what would you do to improve Kubuntu? What&#8217;s your idea for doing things better?<br />
&lt;clivejo&gt; I want to help get KDE software into the Ubuntu ecosystem faster and make it easier on the people who do it<br />
&lt;clivejo&gt; people like yofel and sgclark have put a LOT of their time into it, if I can take a little bit of that pressure off them, thats my goal</p></blockquote>
<p>The Kubuntu team would like to offer him a warm welcome, and we&#8217;re greeting him with hugs and work to be done.</p>
<p>For those interested here&#8217;s Clive&#8217;s wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.kubuntu.org/~clivejo" target="_blank">https://wiki.kubuntu.org/~clivejo</a></p>
<p>The interview meeting didn&#8217;t even finish, and Clive was already back to work. Thank you Clive for joining us.</p>
<p>The meeting log is available <a href="http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2016/02/16/%23kubuntu-devel.html#t21:00" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
