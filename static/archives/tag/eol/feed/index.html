<p>As the recently released Kubuntu 21.04 with beautiful Plasma 5.21 makes its way into the world, inevitably other things come to their end.</p>



<p>Kubuntu 18.04 LTS was released in April 2018, and reached &#8216;End of Life&#8217; for its 3 years of flavour support on 1st May 2021. All Kubuntu users should therefore switch to a newer supported release. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the newly released Kubuntu 19.04 makes its way into the world, inevitably other things come to their end.</p>
<p>Kubuntu 14.04 LTS was released in April 2014, and reaches &#8216;End of Life&#8217; for support on 25th April 2019. All Kubuntu users should therefore switch to a newer supported release. Upgrades from 14.04 to a newer release are not advised, so please install a fresh copy of 18.04 or newer after running a backup of all your data.</p>
<p>Kubuntu 16.04 LTS was released on 21st April 2016, and was supported for Kubuntu for a period of year 3 years.* Kubuntu 16.04 LTS support therefore ends 21st April 2019, and users are invited to upgrade to 18.04 LTS, or perform a fresh install of that or newer release.</p>
<p>The Kubuntu team would thank users of both releases, especially for the amazing additional community support on IRC, forums, mailing lists, and elsewhere.</p>
