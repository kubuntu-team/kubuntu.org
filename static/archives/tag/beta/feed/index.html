<p>Are you using Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish, our current Stable release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 22.10 Kinetic Kudu?</p>



<p>We currently have <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/">Plasma 5.24.90 (Plasma 5.25 Beta)</a>  available in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/beta">Beta PPA</a> for Kubuntu 22.04, and in the Ubuntu archive and <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily ISO build</a> for the 22.10 development series.</p>



<p>However this is a beta release, and we should re-iterate the disclaimer from the upstream release announcement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Today we are bringing you the preview version of KDE’s Plasma 5.25 desktop release. Plasma 5.25 Beta is aimed at testers, developers, and bug-hunters.

To help KDE developers iron out bugs and solve issues, install Plasma 5.25 Beta and test run the features listed below. Please report bugs to our bug tracker.

We will be holding a Plasma 5.25 beta review day on May 26 (details will be published on our social media) and you can join us for a day of bug-hunting, triaging and solving alongside the Plasma devs!

The final version of Plasma 5.25 will become available for the general public on the 14th of June.

DISCLAIMER: This release contains untested and unstable software. It is highly recommended you do not use this version in a production environment and do not use it as your daily work environment. You risk crashes and loss of data.</p><cite>https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Testers of the Kubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu development series:</strong></p>



<p>Testers with a current install can simply upgrade their packages to install the 5.25 Beta.</p>



<p>Alternatively, a live/install image is available at: <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/</a></p>



<p><strong>Users on Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish:</strong></p>



<p>5.25 Beta packages and required dependencies are available in our Beta PPA.</p>



<p>The PPA should work whether you are currently using our backports PPA or not.</p>



<p>If you are prepared to test via the PPA, then…..</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Add the beta PPA and then upgrade:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</pre>



<p>Then reboot.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>In case of issues, testers should be prepared to use ppa-purge to remove the PPA and revert/downgrade packages. </strong></em></p></blockquote>



<div style="height:39px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Kubuntu is part of the <a href="https://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/">KDE community</a>,  so this testing will benefit both Kubuntu as well as upstream KDE  Plasma software, which is used by many other distributions too.</p>



<ul><li>If you believe you might have found a packaging bug, you can use  <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad.net</a> to post testing feedback to the Kubuntu team as a bug, or give feedback on IRC [1], or mailing lists [2]. </li><li>If you believe you have found a bug in the underlying software, then <a href="https://bugs.kde.org">bugs.kde.org</a> is the best place to file your bug report.</li></ul>



<p>Please review the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/"></a><a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/">release announcement</a> and  <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.24.5-5.24.90">changelog</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[Test Case]<br>* General tests:<br>&#8211; Does plasma desktop start as normal with no apparent regressions over 5.24?<br>&#8211; General workflow &#8211; testers should carry out their normal tasks, using the plasma features they normally do, and test common subsystems such as audio, settings changes, compositing, desktop affects, suspend etc.<br>* Specific tests:<br>&#8211; Check the changelog:<br>&#8211; Identify items with front/user facing changes capable of specific testing. <br>&#8211; Test the &#8216;fixed&#8217; functionality or &#8216;new&#8217; feature.</p></blockquote>



<p>Testing may involve some technical set up to do, so while you do not need to be a highly advanced K/Ubuntu user, some proficiently in apt-based package management is advisable.</p>



<p>Testing is very important to the quality of the software Ubuntu and Kubuntu developers package and release.</p>



<p>We need your help to get this important beta release in shape for Kubuntu and the KDE community as a whole.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>



<p>Please stop by the Kubuntu-devel IRC channel on libera.chat if you need clarification of any of the steps to follow.</p>

<p>Are you using Kubuntu 21.04 Hirsute Hippo, our current Stable release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 21.10 Impish Indri?</p>



<p>We currently have <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.22.90/">Plasma 5.22.90 (Plasma 5.23 Anniversary Edition Beta)</a>&nbsp; available in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/beta">Beta PPA</a> for Kubuntu 21.04, and 21.10 development series.</p>



<p>However this is a beta release, and we should re-iterate the disclaimer from the upstream release announcement:</p>

<p><strong>Note: Users of 21.04 Hirsute Hippo who have installed packages from the BETA PPA should run &#8216;sudo ppa-purge kubuntu-ppa/beta&#8217; once they have finished testing, and before attempting to upgrade to 21.10 when it is released. Failure to do so is likely to break upgrades.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The PPA should work whether you are currently using our backports PPA or not.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Also</strong> <strong>Impish Indri 21.10 will ship with Plasma 5.22.5 by default. However we aim to make 5.23 available in the backports PPA soon after release. This testing will help that aim.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kubuntu 20.04 Testing Week</strong></p>
<p>The Kubuntu team is delighted to announce an ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from April 2nd to April 8th with other flavors in the Ubuntu family. April 2nd is the beta release of what will become Kubuntu 20.04 and during this week, there will be a freeze on changes to features, the user interface and documentation. Between April 2nd and final release on April 23rd, the Kubuntu team and community will focus on ISO testing, bug reporting, and fixing bugs. Please join the community by downloading the daily ISO image and trying it out, even beginning today.</p>
<p><a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/408/builds">QA tracker</a>: <a href="http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/408/builds">http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/408/builds</a></p>
<p>From this main page, click on the ‘Kubuntu Desktop amd64’ link to arrive at the testcases page. On the testcases page, you can download the ISO by clicking the ‘Link to the download information’ and report test results to the various test cases for Kubuntu. If you see other flavors needing testing on the main page, please test for them as well.</p>
<p>Chat live on <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/#ubuntu-quality?nick=kubuntu-tester?w">IRC</a> (#ubuntu-quality) or <a href="https://t.me/UbuntuTesters">Telegram</a> (UbuntuTesters: <a href="https://t.me/UbuntuTesters">https://t.me/UbuntuTesters</a>) if you like, during this time of pandemic social distancing.</p>
<p>If you have no spare computer to use for testing, no problem! You can test without changing your system by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine) with software like Virtualbox, or running it in the live session from a USB or DVD, so you can also test if your hardware works correctly. We encourage those that are willing, to install it either in a VM or on physical hardware&#8211;requires at least 6GB of harddisk space&#8211;and use it continuously for a few days, as more bugs can be exposed and reported this way.</p>
<p>The easy way to report a bug is to open up Konsole by pressing alt+space and typing konsole or Menu &gt; Konsole and then typing `ubuntu-bug packagename`, where packagename is the program or application where you experience the bug.</p>
<p>If you prefer working in the terminal, open the virtual console (terminal) by pressing control + alt + F2, 3, 4 etc. and typing `<em>ubuntu-bug packagename</em>`, where packagename is the program or application where you experience the bug. Control + Alt + F1 to return to your desktop. If a crash has landed you in the terminal, login with your usual user name and password, and report the bug as above.</p>
<p>Here is a nice youtube video showing the entire process, including one way to figure out what packagename is appropriate in GNOME: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTyzyY9RHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTyzyY9RHw</a></p>
<p>Using ‘ubuntu-bug’ will automatically upload error logs and/or other files to Launchpad that developers need to fix the bug. By the way, the installer’s packagename is ubiquity. Experience tells us that is the most useful packagename to know for ISO testing when things go wrong with the installation. The live session software package is casper, should you encounter bugs affecting the live session itself, not programs. Other programs with bugs should be filed against their packages, for instance firefox, dolphin, vlc, etc. Only the bug *number* is needed when reporting the results of a test on the QA tracker.</p>
<p>Please test programs / applications that you regularly use, so you can identify bugs and regressions that should be reported. New ISO files are built every day; always test with the most up-to-date ISO. It is easier and faster to update an existing daily ISO with the command below (first right-click on the ISO’s folder in Dolphin and select ‘Open in Terminal’) or just open konsole or yakuake and `cd path-to-ISO-folder`. Zsync downloads only changes, so it’s very quick.<br />
$ <em>zsync http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/focal-desktop-amd64.iso.zsync</em></p>

<p>Are you using Kubuntu 19.10 Eoan Ermine, our current Stable release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa?</p>



<p>We currently have <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.17.90.php">Plasma 5.17.90</a> (Plasma 5.18 Beta)  available in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/beta">Beta PPA</a> for Kubuntu 19.10.</p>



<p>The 5.18 beta is also available in the main Ubuntu archive for the 20.04 development release, and can be found on our <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily ISO images</a>.</p>



<p><strong>This is a Beta Plasma release, so testers should be aware that bugs and issues may exist.</strong><br></p>



<p>If you are prepared to test, then&#8230;..</p>



<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>For 19.10 add the PPA and then upgrade</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta &amp;&amp; sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</pre>



<p>Then reboot. If you cannot reboot from the application launcher,</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">systemctl reboot</pre>



<p>from the terminal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>In case of issues, testers should be prepare to use ppa-purge to remove the PPA and revert/downgrade packages. </strong></em></p><p></p></blockquote>



<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Kubuntu is part of the <a href="https://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/">KDE community</a>, so this testing will benefit both Kubuntu as well as upstream KDE Plasma software, which is used by many other distributions too.</p>



<ul><li>If you believe you might have found a packaging bug, you can use a  <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad.net</a> to post testing feedback to the Kubuntu team as a bug, or give feedback on IRC [1], Telegram [2] or mailing lists [3]. </li><li>If you believe you have found a bug in the underlying software, then&nbsp;<a href="https://bugs.kde.org">bugs.kde.org</a> is the best place to file your bug report.</li></ul>



<p>Please review the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.17.90.php">release announcement</a> and  <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.17.5-5.17.90-changelog.php">changelog.</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[Test Case]</p><p>* General tests:<br>&#8211; Does plasma desktop start as normal with no apparent regressions over 5.16 or 5.17?<br>&#8211; General workflow &#8211; testers should carry out their normal tasks, using the plasma features they normally do, and test common subsystems such as audio, settings changes, compositing, desktop affects, suspend etc.</p><p>* Specific tests:<br>&#8211; Check the changelog:<br>&#8211; Identify items with front/user facing changes capable of specific testing. e.g. &#8220;clock combobox instead of tri-state checkbox for 12/24 hour display.&#8221;<br>&#8211; Test the &#8216;fixed&#8217; functionality or &#8216;new&#8217; feature.</p></blockquote>



<p>Testing involves some technical set up to do, so while you do not need to be a highly advanced K/Ubuntu user, some proficiently in apt-based package management is advisable.</p>



<p>Testing is very important to the quality of the software Ubuntu and Kubuntu developers package and release.</p>



<p>We need your help to get this important beta release in shape for Kubuntu and the KDE community as a whole.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>



<p>Please stop by the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/kubuntu-devel">Kubuntu-devel IRC channel</a> or <a href="https://t.me/kubuntu_support">Telegram group</a> if you need clarification of any of the steps to follow.</p>
