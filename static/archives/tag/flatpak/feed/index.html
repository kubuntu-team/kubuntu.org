<p>Kubuntu is and has always been &#8220;Ubuntu&#8221; combined with the greatest software from the KDE Community. Prior to 23.04 and aligned with Debian packaging, Flatpak and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/services/guide/snaps-intro">Snap</a> package sources were included as installable options with each source requiring its own set of commands and repositories. However, enabling both sources caused confusion with new users (and *Ubuntu support groups) as the user was unsure about several issues including which or how their packages were installed; the proper place to report issues; and/or how to remove them. As a result, Canonical, Ubuntu&#8217;s parent company, and the Ubuntu Technical Board have chosen to support Snaps only upon initial install.</p>



<p>User and community member, arraybolt3, provides more <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061/9">details</a> regarding challenges of Flatpak support.</p>



<p>No worries; Flatpaks are still available for all Ubuntu flavors. To enable Flatpaks in KDE&#8217;s Discover in Kubuntu 23.04, run this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install flatpak plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</code></pre>



<p>To enable the largest Flatpak repository, run this command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo</code></pre>



<p>Log out and log back in (or restart) to re-initialize  the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable, otherwise, newly installed Flatpak apps will not run or appear in the startup menu. </p>
