<p>Behind the scenes with Kubuntu, we build packages, then test and finally release to our users. We mostly rely on the building services provided by Canonical on <a href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>, but also are lucky enough to have services donated by some third parties.  A lot of our developers are working on quite slow internet connections and when working with large source-code tarballs this takes a very long time, is painful and quite honestly leads to developers burning out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been thankful that <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> have come to the rescue by providing a server for developers to work from.  This machine is connected to the internet by a blazing fast connection, plenty of RAM and 8 CPU cores.  A release which takes 30-60 minutes to do on a home connection can be sped up by a factor of <em>ten</em>!</p>
<p>Linode has kindly agreed to extend this donation for another year and the Kubuntu team would like to thank them very much for doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3508" src="//kubuntu.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/e373/thank-you.png" alt="" width="640" height="400" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third point release update to Kubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) is out now. This contains all the bug-fixes added to 16.04 since its first release in April 2016. Users of 16.04 can run the normal update procedure to get these bug-fixes. In addition, we suggest adding the Backports PPA to update to Plasma 5.8.7. Read more about it:</p>
<p><a href="http://kubuntu.org/news/latest-round-of-backports-ppa-updates-include-plasma-5-10-2-for-zesty-17-04/">http://kubuntu.org/news/latest-round-of-backports-ppa-updates-include-plasma-5-10-2-for-zesty-17-04/</a></p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS upgrades are problematic, and should not be attempted by the average user. Please install a fresh copy of 16.04.3 instead. To prevent messages about upgrading, change Prompt=lts with Prompt=normal or Prompt=never in the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades file. As always, make a thorough backup of your data before upgrading.</p>
<p>See the Ubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes">16.04.3 release announcement</a> and Kubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes/Kubuntu">Release Notes</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at 15:58 UTC the Kubuntu Council approved Darin Miller&#8217;s application for becoming a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-members">Kubuntu Member</a>.</p>
<p>Darin has been coming to the development channel and taking part in the informal developer meetings on Big Blue Button for a while now, helping out were he can with the packaging and continuous integration.  His efforts have already made a huge difference.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet of his interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;DarinMiller&gt; I have contributed very little independently, but I have helped fix lintian issues, control files deps, and made a very minor mod to one of the KA scripts.<br />
&lt;clivejo&gt; minor mod?<br />
&lt;acheronuk&gt; very useful mod IIR ^^^<br />
&lt;clivejo&gt; I think you are selling yourself short there!<br />
-*- clivejo was very frustrated with the tooling prior to that fix<br />
&lt;DarinMiller&gt; From coding perspective, it was well within my skillset, so the mod seemed minor to me.<br />
&lt;clivejo&gt; well it was much appreciated<br />
&lt;yofel&gt; when did you start hanging out here and how did you end up in this channel?<br />
&lt;DarinMiller&gt; That&#8217;s another reason I like this team. I feel my efforts are appreciated.<br />
&lt;DarinMiller&gt; And that encourages me to want to do more.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is obviously a very modest chap and the Kubuntu team would like to offer him a very warm welcome, as well as greeting him with our hugs and the list of jobs / work to be done!</p>
<p>For those interested here&#8217;s Darin&#8217;s wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.kubuntu.org/~darinmiller" target="_blank">https://wiki.kubuntu.org/~darinmiller</a> and his Launchpad page: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~darinmiller">https://launchpad.net/~darinmiller</a></p>
<p>The meeting log is available <a href="https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2017/03/18/%23kubuntu-devel.html#t15:07" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
