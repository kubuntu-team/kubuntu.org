<p>The beta of Kubuntu Lunar Lobster (to become 23.04 in April) has now been released, and is available for <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/23.04/beta/">download</a>.</p>



<p>This milestone features images for Kubuntu and other Ubuntu flavours.</p>



<p>Pre-releases of Kubuntu Lunar Lobster are not recommended for:</p>



<ul><li>Anyone needing a stable system</li><li>Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues</li><li>Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable</li></ul>



<p>They are, however, recommended for:</p>



<ul><li>Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs</li><li>Kubuntu, KDE, and Qt developers</li><li>Other Ubuntu flavour developers</li></ul>



<p>The Beta includes some software updates that are ready for broader testing. However, it is an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs.</p>



<p><strong>We STRONGLY advise testers to read the </strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LunarLobster/Beta/Kubuntu"><strong>Kubuntu 23.04 Beta release notes</strong></a><strong> before installing, and in particular the section on &#8216;</strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LunarLobster/Beta/Kubuntu#Known_issues"><strong>Known issues</strong></a><strong>&#8216;.</strong></p>



<p>Kubuntu took part in ‘Ubuntu Testing Week’ from March 2nd to March 9th. Details for all flavours are available on the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-23-04-testing-week/34246">Ubuntu Discourse announcement</a>.</p>



<p>You can also find more information about the entire 23.04 release (base, kernel, graphics etc) in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-notes/31910">main Ubuntu Beta release notes</a> and <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2023-March/000288.html">announcement.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>To enable Flatpaks in KDE’s Discover in Kubuntu 23.04, run this command:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt install flatpak plasma-discover-backend-flatpak</code><br></p>



<p>To enable the largest Flatpak repository, run this command:</p>



<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo<br></code></p>



<p>Log out and log back in (or restart) to re-initialize the XDG_DATA_DIRS variable, otherwise, newly installed Flatpak apps will not run or appear in the startup menu.</p>

<p>We have had many requests to make Plasma 5.27.2 available in our backports PPA for Kubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu).</p>



<p>As usual with our PPAs, there is the caveat that the PPA may receive additional updates and new releases of KDE Plasma, Gear (Apps), and Frameworks, plus other apps and required libraries. Users should always review proposed updates to decide whether they wish to receive them.</p>



<p>To add the PPA and upgrade, do:</p>



<p><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</code></p>



<p>We hope keen adopters enjoy using Plasma 5.27.2!</p>



<p>Note that Plasma 5.27 is also available for our <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">current development version</a>, Lunar Lobster, to become Kubuntu 23.04.</p>

<p id="block-dce1fdc9-61ab-4be3-afe1-dea26d2c4dd1">Are you using Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish, our current stable LTS release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 22.10 Kinetic Kudu?</p>



<p id="block-4987ddc6-d994-4a39-bed0-3920182a4aeb">We currently have <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.90/">Plasma 5.25.90 (Plasma 5.26 Beta)</a> available in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/beta">Beta PPA</a> for Kubuntu 22.04 and for the <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">22.10 development series</a>.</p>



<p id="block-16649c01-ee97-4281-9199-db9cb03846de">However this is a beta release, and we should re-iterate the disclaimer from the upstream release announcement:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: This release contains untested and unstable software. It is highly recommended you <strong>do not use this version in a production environment</strong> and do not use it as your daily work environment. You risk crashes and loss of data.</p><cite>https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.90/</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p id="block-e74d4292-72a7-4422-9dc3-972f16f92bdb">5.26 Beta packages and required dependencies are available in our Beta PPA. The PPA should work whether you are currently using our backports PPA or not. If you are prepared to test via the PPA, then add the beta PPA and then upgrade:</p>



<pre id="block-e003006f-30b6-4a30-9d43-0b939ff58999" class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</pre>



<p id="block-c1dda163-92b7-4345-8193-238a9e162e08">Then reboot.</p>



<p><em><strong>In case of issues, testers should be prepared to use ppa-purge to remove the PPA and revert/downgrade packages.</strong></em></p>



<p id="block-b51fa61f-525b-4200-bc63-0331a8ac0856">Kubuntu is part of the <a href="https://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/">KDE community</a>, so this testing will benefit both Kubuntu as well as upstream KDE Plasma software, which is used by many other distributions too.</p>



<ul id="block-a230270c-cb22-4961-969f-84622082b203"><li>If you believe you might have found a packaging bug, you can use <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad.net</a> to post testing feedback to the Kubuntu team as a bug, or give feedback on IRC [1], or mailing lists [2].</li><li>If you believe you have found a bug in the underlying software, then&nbsp;<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/">bugs.kde.org</a> is the best place to file your bug report.</li></ul>



<p id="block-c4b19c63-340e-4482-813e-ad95301ebeb4">Please review the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/"></a><a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.90/">release announcement</a> and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.25.5-5.25.90/">changelog</a>.</p>



<p>[Test Case]<br>* General tests:<br>&#8211; Does plasma desktop start as normal with no apparent regressions over 5.24?<br>&#8211; General workflow &#8211; testers should carry out their normal tasks, using the plasma features they normally do, and test common subsystems such as audio, settings changes, compositing, desktop affects, suspend etc.<br>* Specific tests:<br>&#8211; Check the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.25.5-5.25.90/">changelog</a>:<br>&#8211; Identify items with front/user facing changes capable of specific testing.<br>&#8211; Test the &#8216;fixed&#8217; functionality or &#8216;new&#8217; feature.</p>



<p id="block-578b61d8-9402-44dd-aede-d9289bbb561a">Testing may involve some technical set up to do, so while you do not need to be a highly advanced K/Ubuntu user, some proficiently in apt-based package management is advisable.</p>



<p id="block-03036906-2d18-4566-9de0-677f7b49a9d2">Testing is very important to the quality of the software Ubuntu and Kubuntu developers package and release.</p>



<p id="block-d033d2c3-fea5-4d09-a55b-fc2b38a245e5">We need your help to get this important beta release in shape for Kubuntu and the KDE community as a whole.</p>



<p id="block-042b9ac8-ab90-47b2-9a04-758902be0c13">Thanks!</p>



<p id="block-5709735d-7df8-4c30-8d09-f47a2f0ebe6c">Please stop by the Kubuntu-devel IRC channel on libera.chat if you need clarification of any of the steps to follow.</p>
