<p>We have had many requests to make Plasma 5.27 available in our backports PPA for Jammy Jellyfish 22.04. However, for technical reasons this would have broken upgrades to Kinetic 22.10 while that upgrade path existed. Now that Kinetic is end of life, it is possible to allow opt in backports of plasma 5.27 for 22.04.</p>



<p>As with the previous backport of plasma 5.25, 5.27 is provided in the backports-extra PPA</p>



<p>This PPA is intended to be used in combination with our standard backports PPA, but should also work standalone.</p>



<p>As usual with our PPAs, there is the caveat that the PPA may receive additional updates and new releases of KDE Plasma, Gear (Apps) and Frameworks, plus other apps and required libraries. Users should always review proposed updates to decide whether they wish to receive them.</p>



<p><em>While we feel these backports will be beneficial to enthusiastic adopters, users wanting to use a more tested Plasma release on the 22.04 base may find it advisable to stay with Plasma 5.24 as included in the original 22.04 (Jammy) release.</em></p>



<p>To add the PPA and upgrade, do:</p>



<p><em>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</em></p>



<p>We hope keen adopters enjoy using Plasma 5.27</p>

<p>We have had many requests to make Plasma 5.25 available in our backports PPA for Jammy Jellyfish 22.04.</p>



<p>Providing backports of new Plasma versions to a LTS release always must be an &#8216;opt-in&#8217; process, however we are aware that many of our users now are accustomed to adding our backports PPA as a matter of course, so for a LTS release some additional caution is required in what we make available there.</p>



<p>Therefore, at least for the time being, Plasma 5.25 will be available via an additional &#8216;backports-extra&#8217; PPA, so users can make a positive informed choice to upgrade.</p>



<p>This PPA is intended to be used in combination with our standard backports PPA, but should also work standalone.</p>



<p>As usual with our PPAs, there is the caveat that the PPA may receive additional updates and new releases of KDE Plasma, Gear (Apps) and Frameworks, plus other apps and required libraries. Users should always review proposed updates to decide whether they wish to receive them.</p>



<p>To add the PPA and upgrade, do:</p>



<p><em>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports-extra &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</em></p>



<p>We hope keen adopters enjoy using Plasma 5.25</p>

<p>Are you using Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish, our current Stable release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 22.10 Kinetic Kudu?</p>



<p>We currently have <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/">Plasma 5.24.90 (Plasma 5.25 Beta)</a>  available in our <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/beta">Beta PPA</a> for Kubuntu 22.04, and in the Ubuntu archive and <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">daily ISO build</a> for the 22.10 development series.</p>



<p>However this is a beta release, and we should re-iterate the disclaimer from the upstream release announcement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Today we are bringing you the preview version of KDE’s Plasma 5.25 desktop release. Plasma 5.25 Beta is aimed at testers, developers, and bug-hunters.

To help KDE developers iron out bugs and solve issues, install Plasma 5.25 Beta and test run the features listed below. Please report bugs to our bug tracker.

We will be holding a Plasma 5.25 beta review day on May 26 (details will be published on our social media) and you can join us for a day of bug-hunting, triaging and solving alongside the Plasma devs!

The final version of Plasma 5.25 will become available for the general public on the 14th of June.

DISCLAIMER: This release contains untested and unstable software. It is highly recommended you do not use this version in a production environment and do not use it as your daily work environment. You risk crashes and loss of data.</p><cite>https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90</cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Testers of the Kubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu development series:</strong></p>



<p>Testers with a current install can simply upgrade their packages to install the 5.25 Beta.</p>



<p>Alternatively, a live/install image is available at: <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/</a></p>



<p><strong>Users on Kubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish:</strong></p>



<p>5.25 Beta packages and required dependencies are available in our Beta PPA.</p>



<p>The PPA should work whether you are currently using our backports PPA or not.</p>



<p>If you are prepared to test via the PPA, then…..</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Add the beta PPA and then upgrade:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta &amp;&amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y</pre>



<p>Then reboot.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>In case of issues, testers should be prepared to use ppa-purge to remove the PPA and revert/downgrade packages. </strong></em></p></blockquote>



<div style="height:39px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Kubuntu is part of the <a href="https://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/">KDE community</a>,  so this testing will benefit both Kubuntu as well as upstream KDE  Plasma software, which is used by many other distributions too.</p>



<ul><li>If you believe you might have found a packaging bug, you can use  <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad.net</a> to post testing feedback to the Kubuntu team as a bug, or give feedback on IRC [1], or mailing lists [2]. </li><li>If you believe you have found a bug in the underlying software, then <a href="https://bugs.kde.org">bugs.kde.org</a> is the best place to file your bug report.</li></ul>



<p>Please review the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/"></a><a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/">release announcement</a> and  <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.24.5-5.24.90">changelog</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[Test Case]<br>* General tests:<br>&#8211; Does plasma desktop start as normal with no apparent regressions over 5.24?<br>&#8211; General workflow &#8211; testers should carry out their normal tasks, using the plasma features they normally do, and test common subsystems such as audio, settings changes, compositing, desktop affects, suspend etc.<br>* Specific tests:<br>&#8211; Check the changelog:<br>&#8211; Identify items with front/user facing changes capable of specific testing. <br>&#8211; Test the &#8216;fixed&#8217; functionality or &#8216;new&#8217; feature.</p></blockquote>



<p>Testing may involve some technical set up to do, so while you do not need to be a highly advanced K/Ubuntu user, some proficiently in apt-based package management is advisable.</p>



<p>Testing is very important to the quality of the software Ubuntu and Kubuntu developers package and release.</p>



<p>We need your help to get this important beta release in shape for Kubuntu and the KDE community as a whole.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>



<p>Please stop by the Kubuntu-devel IRC channel on libera.chat if you need clarification of any of the steps to follow.</p>

<p>Are you using Kubuntu 21.04 Hirsute Hippo, our current Stable release? Or are you already running our development builds of the upcoming 21.10 Impish Indri?</p>

<p><strong>Note: Users of 21.04 Hirsute Hippo who have installed packages from the BETA PPA should run &#8216;sudo ppa-purge kubuntu-ppa/beta&#8217; once they have finished testing, and before attempting to upgrade to 21.10 when it is released. Failure to do so is likely to break upgrades.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The PPA should work whether you are currently using our backports PPA or not.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Also</strong> <strong>Impish Indri 21.10 will ship with Plasma 5.22.5 by default. However we aim to make 5.23 available in the backports PPA soon after release. This testing will help that aim.</strong></p>



<p>If you are prepared to test, then…..</p>



<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<ul><li>If you believe you might have found a packaging bug, you can use a  <a href="https://launchpad.net/">launchpad.net</a> to post testing feedback to the Kubuntu team as a bug, or give feedback on IRC [1], or mailing lists [2]. </li><li>If you believe you have found a bug in the underlying software, then&nbsp;<a href="https://bugs.kde.org">bugs.kde.org</a> is the best place to file your bug report.</li></ul>



<p>Please review the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.21.90/">release announcement</a> and  <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.21.5-5.21.90/">changelog.</a></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[Test Case]<br>* General tests:<br>&#8211; Does plasma desktop start as normal with no apparent regressions over 5.21?<br>&#8211; General workflow &#8211; testers should carry out their normal tasks, using the plasma features they normally do, and test common subsystems such as audio, settings changes, compositing, desktop affects, suspend etc.<br>* Specific tests:<br>&#8211; Check the changelog:<br>&#8211; Identify items with front/user facing changes capable of specific testing. <br>&#8211; Test the &#8216;fixed&#8217; functionality or &#8216;new&#8217; feature.</p></blockquote>



<p>Testing may involve some technical set up to do, so while you do not need to be a highly advanced K/Ubuntu user, some proficiently in apt-based package management is advisable.</p>



<p>Testing is very important to the quality of the software Ubuntu and Kubuntu developers package and release.</p>



<p>We need your help to get this important beta release in shape for Kubuntu and the KDE community as a whole.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>



<p>Please stop by the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/kubuntu-devel">Kubuntu-devel IRC channel</a> if you need clarification of any of the steps to follow.</p>
