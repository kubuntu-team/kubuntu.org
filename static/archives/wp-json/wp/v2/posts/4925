The council formalises and ratifies proposals, then votes to obtain an outcome which directs the course of progress for Kubuntu.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On 11 September I (Rick Timmis) will have been a councilor for the Kubuntu Council for 5 years. Being a councilor is a lot of fun, provides a wonderful sense of fulfillment and also carries a lot of &#8216;Kudos&#8217; in conversations with those of a technical persuasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been using Kubuntu for a while, and have explored some of our community, why not consider getting involved a little deeper ? We are always looking for testers, contributors, bug reporters, documentation, and blog writers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a Kubuntu member is the next step up from being a contributor, and if you&#8217;ve already made a few contributions over the last 3 to 6 months, then you should consider making an application to become a member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kubuntu members are also entitled to stand for election to the Kubuntu council, where you get to support the development of the Kubuntu project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 council positions came up for election, as their 2 year terms were coming to an end. We are delighted to announce that existing councillors Myriam Schwiengruber, and Valorie Zimmerman were elected for a further term of 2 years. Simon Quigley has step down from the Council, and we thank him greatly for his many contributions to the project.<br>Stepping in to replace Simon, we are delighted to have Darin Miller join the Kubuntu council, Welcome Darin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Members of the Kubuntu Council are responsible for considering proposals made by the wider Kubuntu community.
