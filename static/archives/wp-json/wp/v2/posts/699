This release will allow you to follow closely with what is going on in the KDE 4.2 development branch. Some of your plasmoids from KDE 4.1 may be incompatible with KDE 4.2 (and will be removed during the upgrade). Also, if you absolutely need MSN support in Kopete you probably don&#8217;t want to upgrade, as the MSN protocol is temporarily unavailable while we package new libraries needed for the rewritten MSN plugin.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the release itself, please see the <a href=\"http:\/\/kde.org\/announcements\/announce-4.2-beta1.php\">Release Announcement<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Instructions<\/h3>\n<p>The updated packages for Kubuntu 8.10 are located in the Kubuntu Experimental Software Personal Package Archive (PPA) repository. To update to KDE 4.1.80 (4.2 beta1), please follow these instructions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the koffice-data-kde4 package. The current koffice2 packages are incompatible with the KDE 4.2 packages since they try to install icons to the same places.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/community\/Repositories\/Kubuntu\">Kubuntu Repository Guide<\/a> to enable <em>Recommended Updates<\/em> and add the following to your &#8216;Third-Party Software&#8217; tab:\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #dae9fd; background-color: #eff5fc; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">deb http:\/\/ppa.launchpad.net\/kubuntu-experimental\/ubuntu intrepid main<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">You can now update any existing KDE 4 installation to the most recent version using the Adept Updater tool in your system tray.<\/li>\n<li>Now log out and press Alt + E to restart X. When you log in you will have KDE 4.2 Beta 1. Enjoy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bugs<\/h3>\n<p>There probably will be many bugs with this release and it is recommended that you do not file bug reports against the packages in this release. If you come across any issue which may be packaging related, it is recommended that you join the Kubuntu IRC channel (#kubuntu on irc.freenode.net) and query those in the channel for assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Richard <em>&#8220;Arby&#8221;<\/em> Birnie, Harald <em>&#8220;apachelogger&#8221; <\/em> Sitter, Jonathan Thomas <em>(aka JontheEchidna)<\/em>, Michael <em>&#8220;NCommander&#8221;<\/em> Casadevall and Steve Stalcup <em>(aka vorian)<\/em> for preparing these packages.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see your name above, then join the Kubuntu Team.<br \/>\nMore information is available in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.kubuntu.org\/Kubuntu\">Kubuntu Wiki<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KDE 4.2 Beta 1 has been released and packages are available for Kubuntu 8.10, the Intrepid Ibex.
