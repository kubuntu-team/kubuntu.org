This release will allow you to follow closely with what is going on in the KDE 4.2 development branch. Some of your plasmoids from KDE 4.1 may be incompatible with KDE 4.2 (and will be removed during the upgrade).<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the release itself, please see the <a href=\"http:\/\/kde.org\/announcements\/announce-4.2-rc.php\">Release Announcement<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Jaunty<\/h3>\n<p>Packages for the development Jaunty release are available. If you use Jaunty you will be able to upgrade as normal. Note that due to the holidays, the red tape needed to include libmsn in main has not been cleared yet. MSN support for Kopete will go in to Jaunty before it is released, however.<\/p>\n<h3>8.10 (Intrepid)<\/h3>\n<p>Packages for (K)Ubuntu 8.10 can be installed by following the instructions below. If you installed KDE 4.1 Beta2 you can merely update your existing installation.<\/p>\n<h3>Instructions<\/h3>\n<p>The updated packages for Kubuntu 8.10 are located in the Kubuntu Experimental Software Personal Package Archive (PPA) repository. To update to KDE 4.1.96 (4.2 RC 1), please follow these instructions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the koffice-data-kde4 package if you have it installed. The current koffice2 packages in the kubuntu-members-kde4 PPA are incompatible with the KDE 4.2 packages since they try to install icons to the same locations.<\/li>\n<li>Follow the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/community\/Repositories\/Kubuntu\">Kubuntu Repository Guide<\/a> to enable <em>Recommended Updates<\/em> and add the following to your &#8216;Third-Party Software&#8217; tab:\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #dae9fd; background-color: #eff5fc; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">deb http:\/\/ppa.launchpad.net\/kubuntu-experimental\/ubuntu intrepid main<\/div>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">You can now update any existing KDE 4 installation to the most recent version using the Adept Updater tool in your system tray.<\/li>\n<li>Now log out and press Alt + E to restart X. When you log in you will have KDE 4.2 Release Candidate 1. Enjoy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Bugs<\/h3>\n<p>There probably will at least a few bugs with this release and it is recommended that you do not file bug reports against the packages in this release. If you come across any issue which may be packaging related, it is recommended that you join the Kubuntu IRC channel (#kubuntu on irc.freenode.net) and query those in the channel for assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Harald <em>&#8220;apachelogger&#8221; <\/em> Sitter, Jonathan Riddell, Jonathan Thomas <em>(aka JontheEchidna)<\/em>, Scott <em>&#8220;ScottK&#8221;<\/em> Kitterman and Steve Stalcup <em>(aka vorian)<\/em> for preparing and uploading these packages.
