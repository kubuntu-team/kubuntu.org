And we have new applications that we&#8217;re so proud of: latte-dock, Falkon, kio-gdrive and Peruse, a KDE comic reader. Kio-gdrive enables KIO-aware applications (such as Dolphin, Kate or Gwenview) to access and edit Google Drive files on the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made some notable changes since 16.04 LTS. VLC is the default media player, and Cantata Qt5 the default music player. Muon is now shipped by default for those who prefer a package manager as an alternative to the Plasma Discover software store, both of which have seen major improvements.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made some important but smaller changes since 16.04 LTS and 17.10. Kubuntu switches to a dark Breeze Plasma theme by default from 18.04, made some changes in default settings and now offer a minimal install option on the ISO. This removes KDE PIM applications, Libreoffice, Cantata and mpd, and some additional internet and media applications. At present a full Plasma Desktop is left in place, plus basic applications and utilities. Firefox as a browser, and VLC as a media player, are also retained.<\/p>\n<p>Double-click is now default to open files.
