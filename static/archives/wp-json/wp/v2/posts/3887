My attraction to the KDE desktop and associated application set, has drawn from Kubuntu user, to a tester, teacher, developer, community manager and councilor. I feel really privileged to be part of, what can only be described as, a remarkable example of the free software, and community development of an exceptional product.<\/p>\n<p>This latest release 18.04, effectively the April 2018 release, is a major milestone. It is the first LTS Long Term Support release of Kubuntu running the &#8220;Plasma 5&#8221; desktop.<br \/>\nThe improvements are so considerable, in both performance and modern user interface ( UI ) design, that I was really excited about wanting to tell the world about it. <\/p>\n<p>Which is why I was completely ecstatic when I was commissioned by Linux Magazine to write a 2000 word article, spanning some 4 pages, as a major review center piece in their magazine.<\/p>\n<p>Published as &#8220;Linux Pro Magazine&#8221; in the US and &#8220;Linux Magazine&#8221; in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>In the article I dive into one of the greatest and most unsung features of KDE Plasma 5; &#8220;Activities&#8221;. The introduction of activities in KDE has been a revelation to me, and completely changed the way that I work on a day to day basis. I encourage you whole heartedly to explore them, if you  haven&#8217;t done so already.<\/p>\n<p>Published in the August 2018 edition, and from which the introduction is available online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linux-magazine.com\/Issues\/2018\/213\/Kubuntu-18.04\">http:\/\/www.linux-magazine.com\/Issues\/2018\/213\/Kubuntu-18.04<\/a> or of course you can buy the August issue from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linux-magazine.com\/Issues\/2018\/213\">http:\/\/www.linux-magazine.com\/Issues\/2018\/213<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is fantastic to see Kubuntu hitting the main stream publishing and to have an in-depth review article in one of the global leading Linux magazines is wonderful. <\/p>\n<p><em>by Rick Timmis<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kubuntu Linux has been my preferred Linux distribution for more than 10 years.
