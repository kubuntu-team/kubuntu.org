MSM wanting to work with us to bring a cloud native Kubuntu Linux laptop to the market, directly aimed at competing with the MacBook Pro. As 2020 has progressed the company has continued to grow and develop the market,  releasing their second model the Kubuntu Focus M2 in October. Their machines are not just being bought by hobby and tech enthusiasts, the Kubuntu Focus team have sold several high spec machines to NASA via their Jet Propulsion Laboratory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/thumbnails\/image\/nasa-logo-web-rgb.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lenovo launches Linux range<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenovo also has a vision for Linux on the Desktop, and as an enterprise class vendor they know where the market is heading.
