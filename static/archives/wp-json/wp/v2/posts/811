As approved by the Ubuntu Technical Board on January 9th, 12.04 will be a 5-year long-term support cycle for Kubuntu. Please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.kubuntu.org\/PrecisePangolin\/Beta1\/Kubuntu\">Beta 1 announcement<\/a> for some of the highlights.<\/p>\n<p>Some recent confusion followed an announcement by Canonical that they would no longer be sponsoring a full-time developer for Kubuntu, or offer commercial support contracts for it.<\/p>\n<p>Kubuntu has always been and always will be a community made project. The Kubuntu Council and community of developers would like to reaffirm their commitment to provide the same level of support for Kubuntu 12.04 as in previous releases, and to ensure that Canonical&#8217;s staffing constraints will not affect the level and quality of support that Kubuntu offers to users. Our 11.10 release was also made without a staff member from Canonical and our future ones will be as well. The Kubuntu contributor community is dedicated to the project and will continue to support and release the latest KDE Software along with Kubuntu every six months.<\/p>\n<p>Users can be assured of continuing support, no matter how small or great their needs.<br \/>\nKubuntu has always been primarily built and supported by an active community of volunteers. If you would like to help build the future of Kubuntu, we welcome new recruits with experience or interest in the following areas: KDE Programming (in C++, QML, Python), Packaging, QA Testing, QA Automation, User support, Bug Triage<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to help, please contact us on the <a href=\"https:\/\/lists.ubuntu.com\/mailman\/listinfo\/kubuntu-devel\">kubuntu-devel mailing list<\/a> or #kubuntu-devel on the FreeNode network.<\/p>\n<p>In Friendship, The Kubuntu Council<br \/>\nChristian Mangold<br \/>\nDavid Wonderly<br \/>\nHarald Sitter<br \/>\nJonathan Riddell<br \/>\nJonathan Thomas<br \/>\nScott Kitterman<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Kubuntu Community is pleased to announce plans for the 12.04 LTS release of Kubuntu.
