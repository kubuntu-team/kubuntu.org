This may be in our future, so it is worth thinking and discussing.<\/p>\n<p>Tobias Fischbach came by the BOF and told us about Limux which is based on Kubuntu. This has been the official computer distribution of Munich for the past few years. Now however, unless the Mayor changes (or changes his mind) the city is moving to Windows again, which will be unfortunate for the City.<\/p>\n<p>Slightly off-topic but relevent is that KDE neon will be moving to 20.04 base soon after release, but they will not stay on the Plasma LTS or Qt LTS. So users who want the very latest in KDE Plasma and applications will continue to have the option of using Neon, while our users, who expect more testing and stability can choose between the LTS for the ultimate in stability and our interim releases for newer Plasma and applications.<\/p>\n<p>Of course we continue to ask for those of our users who want to help the Kubuntu project to volunteer, especially to test. We&#8217;ll soon need testers for the upcoming Eoan, which will become 19.10.
