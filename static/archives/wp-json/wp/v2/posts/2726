There will be presentations, and screen shared live demo&#8217;s. As has been demonstrated in previous parties there is a healthy flow of topical conversations, and lots of interesting people dropping by to say hello.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/bigbluebutton.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/bbb-overview.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"477\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Event un-schedule<\/h2>\n<p>The main focus will be on \u201cMaking Friends and Having Fun!\u201d There is a great party atmosphere with a life of its own, conversation flowing in different directions, based upon who is talking, and who has recently arrived. It is a very loose format of welcoming guests, and getting them involved in the conversation, and in particular focusing on open questions that invite them to introduce their own topics, we guarantee you&#8217;ll feel right at home.<\/p>\n<p>The parties attract a wide audience from beyond the Kubuntu community. At the last party we attracted party-goers from; UBports project, Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Devon and Cornwall Linux User Group and of course Kubuntu.<\/p>\n<p>To make these parties even better we need YOUR HELP. Firstly a party can only be a a party when there are party-goers, so be sure you show up. Secondly make sure you tell everyone you know to come along too.<\/p>\n<p>There will be lots of time for discussion, questions and answers, along with general support and help from the community. At the last event everyone had a really great time, there were laughs, jokes, conversation and information sharing.<\/p>\n<p>The event runs for around 3 hours from 20:00 until about 23:00, with a 30 minute overrun to close everything down.<\/p>\n<p>The link to the conference will be posted on the Kubuntu Podcast <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/b\/112102796730023795852\/events\/cd5cm4806f1sp8mc7gkasvv971o\">Google+ events page<\/a> and also on irc.freenode.net in the #kubuntu channel<\/p>\n<p>Above all we\u2019re going to have fun, chat, share knowledge, party and learn new things. There will be plenty of us on hand to get you started playing and experimenting with Kubuntu. Whether this is your first time trying Kubuntu or you want help with installing, bug fixing, code hacking or packaging.<\/p>\n<p>All are welcome!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Friends it just keeps getting better; we are going to crack open another case of Kubuntu Geek Fun!
