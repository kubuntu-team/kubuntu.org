If you installed KDE 4.2 Beta or RC you can merely update your existing installation.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: These packages are not supported by Canonical; for a stable system it is not recommended to upgrade. KDE 4.2 will be officially supported as part of Kubuntu 9.04 being released April 23rd 2009.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Instructions<\/h4>\n<p>The updated packages for Kubuntu 8.10 are in Unsupported Updates (backports). To update to KDE 4.2, please follow these instructions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nRemove the koffice-data-kde4 package if you have it installed. The current koffice2 packages in the kubuntu-members-kde4 PPA are incompatible with the KDE 4.2 packages since they try to install icons to the same locations.<\/li>\n<li>\nFollow the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/community\/Repositories\/Kubuntu\">Kubuntu Repository Guide<\/a> to enable <em>Recommended Updates<\/em> and <em>Unsupported Updates<\/em>.\n<\/li>\n<li>\nOld Plasma packages are not compatible with KDE 4.2, you should uninstall any plasmoids.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">\nYou can now update any existing KDE 4 installation to 4.2 with Full Upgrade in the package manager, or using the Adept Updater tool in your system tray.\n<\/li>\n<li>\nNow log out. When you log in you will have KDE 4.2. Enjoy.\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Notes<\/h4>\n<p>KDE 4.2 uses Akonadi which will install MySQL.  The MySQL packages in intrepid will ask for a password, you can set this to anything you like.<\/p>\n<p>Digikam will not install alongside these packages due to conflicting library versions.<\/p>\n<h3>Bugs<\/h3>\n<p>If you come across any issue which may be packaging related, it is recommended that you join the Kubuntu IRC channel (#kubuntu on irc.freenode.net) and query those in the channel for assistance.\n<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Harald <em>&#8220;apachelogger&#8221; <\/em>  Sitter, Jonathan Riddell, Jonathan Thomas <em>(aka JontheEchidna)<\/em>, Scott <em>&#8220;ScottK&#8221;<\/em> Kitterman and Steve Stalcup <em>(aka vorian)<\/em>, Nathan Handler, Richard &#8220;Arby&#8221; Birnie and Roderick Greening for preparing and uploading these packages.  <\/p>\n<p>If you want to see your name above, then join the Kubuntu Team.<br \/>\nMore information is available in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.kubuntu.org\/Kubuntu\">Kubuntu Wiki<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KDE 4.2 has been released.
