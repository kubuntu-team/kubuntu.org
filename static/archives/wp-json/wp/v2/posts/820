This could be you! If you are a Kubuntu Member and are willing to turn up to Kubuntu meetings as much as possible for the next couple of years do consider putting your name forward.<\/p>\n<p>We are particularly encouraging non-developers to put their name forward, as we feel that a less development focused council is beneficial for the Kubuntu community.<\/p>\n<p>To put your name forward make sure you update your wiki page and then post to the kubuntu-devel email list (you will have to subscribe first).<\/p>\n<p>To nominate someone else also write to the kubuntu-devel list. It might be a good idea to first have a chat with the affected person. Please note that everyone who was nominated by someone else will have to verify their nomination.<\/p>\n<p>Closing date for nominations is June 9 at 23:59 UTC.<\/p>\n<p>The poll will start on June 10. Voting instructions will be sent to members of the kubuntu-members team with public email addresses on Launchpad directly.  If you do not have a public email address in Launchpad and wish to vote, email me privately with the address you&#8217;d like used you will get a ballot as well.<\/p>\n<p>regards,<br \/>\nHarald for the Kubuntu Council<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Kubuntu Council is a group of 6 Kubuntu Members who get to vote on membership of Kubuntu Members and occasionally other decisions regarding Kubuntu.
