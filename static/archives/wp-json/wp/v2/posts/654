It is optimised for netbook systems (usually a 9 or 10 inch display) with a minimum vertical screen resolution of 576 pixels. It is built on the same KDE 4.3 base as Kubuntu, but uses a technical preview version of KDE&#8217;s forthcoming Plasma Netbook to provide the basic &#8216;desktop&#8217; environment. Kubuntu has worked with the Plasma Netbook developers to provide a basic first look at the initial vision from KDE for supporting netbooks.<\/p>\n<p>Kubuntu Netbook Edition 9.10 will be useful for many, but is not for everyone. It provides an early look at the plasma shell that will enable people to interact with standard KDE applications in a way optimised for netbook systems. It is useful, functional, and reliable. It does have a few rough edges, but should be usable by many people without problems.<\/p>\n<p>The complete version of the KDE netbook experience will be released as part of Kubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04). The current preview is a first effort towards this completed vision for a radically better experience on mobile, low power, net oriented systems.<\/p>\n<p>Installation is done through a USB pen drive. Use &#8221;&#8217;USB Startup Disk Creator&#8221;&#8217; (available in Kubuntu 9.10, to install in 9.04 or for Windows on the Netbook ISO image) to copy the ISO onto a USB disk for your netbook. You can also install by burning the image to a DVD.

Users that wish to be informed of any packages installed from unsigned sources should use the apt-get command line tool as a workaround. (<a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/bugs\/256245\">Launchpad bug<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>KNetworkManager cannot connect to a wireless network with a hidden SSID. Install network-manager-gnome via a wired connection as a workaround. (<a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/bugs\/422174\">Launchpad bug<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;Hardware Drivers&#8221; package in Kubuntu (jockey-kde) requires a local package cache to function properly. Immediately after a new installation, this might not exist. If running jockey-kde after installing Kubuntu, first ensure there is a local package cache by running KPackageKit (K-Menu -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Add and Remove Software) and clicking on software updates or in a Konsole shell doing &#8220;sudo apt-get update&#8221; before running jockey-kde. (<a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/bugs\/462704\">Launchpad bug<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>For Kubuntu Netbook Edition, users who wish to run Wubi from a USB disk that has persistent storage enabled will need to run it with the &#8211;force-wubi option from the Windows command line. (<a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad.net\/bugs\/461566\">Launchpad bug<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>When using the OEM installation option on Kubuntu Netbook Edition, no &#8220;prepare for shipping&#8221; icon is placed on the desktop.
