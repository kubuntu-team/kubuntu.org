These builds are not final.\r\nWe're still waiting on a few more fixes, a few things to migrate, etc.\r\nI've intentionally not updated base-files or the ISO labels to reflect\r\nthe release status (so please don't file bugs about those).\r\n\r\nWhat there are, however, are \"close enough\" for people to be testing in\r\nanger, filing bugs, fixing bugs, iterating image builds, and testing\r\nall over again.  So, please, don't wait until Wednesday night to test,\r\ntesting just before release is TOO LATE to get anything fixed.  Get out\r\nthere, grab your favourite ISO, beat it up, report bugs, escalate bugs,\r\nget things fixed, respin (if you're a flavour lead with access), and\r\ntest, test... And test.  Did I mention testing?  Please[2] test.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n...
