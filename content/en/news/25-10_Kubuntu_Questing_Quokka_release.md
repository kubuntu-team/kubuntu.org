### Bringing the Latest KDE Plasma to Ubuntu's Stable Core

**October 9, 2025** – The Kubuntu team is thrilled to announce the release of Kubuntu 25.10, codenamed "Questing Quokka"!
As a community-driven flavor of Ubuntu, Kubuntu continues its mission to deliver the cutting-edge KDE software ecosystem
on top of Ubuntu's rock-solid foundation. This interim release, aligned with Ubuntu's six-month cycle, packs in the
freshest updates to Plasma, Frameworks, and applications, ensuring a smooth, performant desktop experience for millions
of users worldwide.

**Building** on the Ubuntu 25.10 base released today by Canonical, Kubuntu 25.10 introduces Plasma 6.4.5 as the flagship update,
alongside Qt 6.9, KDE Frameworks 6.17.0, and the latest KDE Gear 25.08 suite. We've also upgraded to Linux kernel 6.17
for enhanced hardware support and efficiency. Whether you're a developer, creator, or everyday user, this release
emphasizes Wayland adoption, modern security, and seamless integration with the open source world.

Kubuntu remains completely free to download, use, and share—empowering our global community to innovate without barriers.

#### Three Exciting New Features for Kubuntu Users

Here are three standout enhancements that Kubuntu 25.10 brings to your desktop, designed to make your workflow faster, 
more secure, and visually stunning:

1. **KDE Plasma 6.4: A Refined and Responsive Desktop**  
   Dive into the fifth feature release of Plasma 6, complete with Qt 6.9 and Frameworks 6.17.0. This update refines the desktop with smoother animations, improved widget customization, and better multi-monitor handling. It's a big win for productivity, letting you tailor your environment like never before while enjoying the stability of Ubuntu's core.

2. **Plasma Wayland as Default Session**  
   Say goodbye to legacy X11 limitations—Wayland is now the go-to session for superior graphics rendering, reduced latency, and enhanced security. With hardware-accelerated compositing baked in, you'll notice snappier video playback and app responsiveness. (X11 fans, no worries: it's still available via a simple package install.) This shift future-proofs your setup for the next era of Linux desktops.

3. **Rust-Powered sudo-rs for Safer System Management**  
   Leveraging Ubuntu's new memory-safe implementations, Kubuntu defaults to sudo-rs—a Rust-based reimplementation of sudo. It slashes vulnerabilities common in traditional tools, making privilege escalation quicker and more secure without compromising usability. Paired with NTS-enabled NTP for tamper-proof time syncing, your system stays locked down while you focus on what matters.

#### What's New Under the Hood

Beyond these highlights, Kubuntu 25.10 inherits Ubuntu's robust platform upgrades:
- **Linux Kernel 6.17**: Better Arm and RISC-V support, nested virtualization, and Intel TDX for confidential computing—ideal for developers and edge deployments.
- **Updated Developer Tools**: OpenJDK 25, Python 3.14 RC3, Golang 1.25, GCC 15, and Rust 1.85 (with 1.88 available) to supercharge your coding sessions.
- **Enhanced Security and Accessibility**: Experimental TPM-backed full disk encryption with recovery options, improved Bluetooth audio (AAC codecs via restricted extras), and broader accessibility features to meet global standards.
- **KDE Applications Galore**: Everything from Dolphin file manager to Konsole terminal refreshed to 25.08 versions, plus legacy Qt5/KF5 support for your favorite older apps.

This release underscores Kubuntu's commitment to being at the heart of the open source ecosystem—pushing boundaries with
KDE while riding Ubuntu's reliable waves. A huge thank you to our volunteer contributors, testers, and the upstream KDE 
team for making this possible.
