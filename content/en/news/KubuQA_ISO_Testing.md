---

The Kubuntu Team are thrilled to announce significant updates to KubuQA, our streamlined ISO testing tool that has now 
expanded its capabilities beyond Kubuntu to support Ubuntu and all its other flavors. With these enhancements, KubuQA 
becomes a versatile resource that ensures a smoother, more intuitive testing process for upcoming releases, including 
the 24.04 Noble Numbat and the 24.10 Oracular Oriole.

## What is KubuQA?
KubuQA is a specialized tool developed by the Kubuntu Team to simplify the process of ISO testing. Utilizing the power 
of Kdialog for user-friendly graphical interfaces and VirtualBox for creating and managing virtual environments, KubuQA 
allows testers to efficiently evaluate ISO images. Its design focuses on accessibility, making it easy for testers of 
all skill levels to participate in the development process by providing clear, guided steps for testing ISOs.

## New Features and Extensions
The latest update to KubuQA marks a significant expansion in its utility:

 - Broader Coverage: Initially tailored for Kubuntu, KubuQA now supports testing ISO images for Ubuntu and all other 
Ubuntu flavors. This broadened coverage ensures that any Ubuntu-based community can benefit from the robust testing framework 
that KubuQA offers.

 - Support for Latest Releases: KubuQA has been updated to include support for the newest Ubuntu release cycles, including 
the 24.04 Noble Numbat and the upcoming 24.10 Oracular Oriole. This ensures that communities can start testing early and
often, leading to more stable and polished releases.

 - Enhanced User Experience: With improvements to the Kdialog interactions, testers will find the interface more intuitive 
and responsive, which enhances the overall testing experience.

## Call to Action for Ubuntu Flavor Leads
The Kubuntu Team is keen to collaborate closely with leaders and testers from all Ubuntu flavors to adopt and adapt 
KubuQA for their testing needs. We believe that by sharing this tool, we can foster a stronger, more cohesive testing 
community across the Ubuntu ecosystem.

We encourage flavor leads to try out KubuQA, integrate it into their testing processes, and share feedback with us. 
This collaboration will not only improve the tool but also ensure that all Ubuntu flavors can achieve higher quality and
stability in their releases.
