The beta of Kubuntu Plucky Puffin (to become 25.04 in April) has now been released, and is available for [download](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/25.04/beta/).

This milestone features images for Kubuntu and other Ubuntu flavours.

Pre-releases of Kubuntu Plucky Puffin are not recommended for:

 - Anyone needing a stable system
 - Regular users who are not aware of pre-release issues
 - Anyone in a production environment with data or workflows that need to be reliable

They are, however, recommended for:

 - Regular users who want to help us test by finding, reporting, and/or fixing bugs
 - Kubuntu, KDE, and Qt developers
 - Other Ubuntu flavour developers

The Beta includes some software updates that are ready for broader testing. However, it is an early set of images, so you should expect some bugs.

Highlights include an update to KDE Plasma 6.3.

**We STRONGLY advise testers to read the [Kubuntu 25.04 Beta release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PluckyPuffin/Beta/Kubuntu) before installing, and in particular the section on [‘Known issues’](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PluckyPuffin/Beta/Kubuntu#Known_issues).**
