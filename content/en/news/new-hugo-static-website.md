title: "The new kubuntu.org website"
---

As some of you have noted, we have recently soft-launched a brand-new Kubuntu website – and we’re excited to announce
that the entire site code is now fully open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/kubuntu-team/kubuntu.org!

This move enables wider contributions from the whole Kubuntu community. Whether you spot a typo, want to improve
accessibility, translate a page, or help shape the next design evolution, you can fork, fix, and send us a pull request.
Together we can make the official home of Kubuntu even better, faster. The previous site ran on WordPress, which always
carried a certain maintenance burden and a defacement risk. We have now switched to a static website generator (Hugo).
That means:

- We can safely sleep at night 😴
- We keep our custom design
- We can push new themed content whenever we need to
- Lightning-fast loading speeds and almost zero server load

We chose a soft launch so we can enable features and polish the design as we go. That’s why we started with AI-generated
placeholder images – they’ve been replaced with proper Kubuntu artwork very soon. The new site already renders much faster
than the old one, it’s inherently safer without server-side scripting, and with your kind assistance we’ll have it in
tip-top shape in just days. Check out the latest commits in the public repository and follow the progress live! If you
enjoy giving back to open source, your help is more than welcome:

- Report remaining issues
- Submit well-crafted PRs (after syncing with our roadmap)
- Translate content
- Improve the theme

At the same time, the team is heads-down preparing for Kubuntu 26.04 LTS, and we’ll share a proper update as we approach
this next major milestone.

Thank you for being part of the Kubuntu family – let’s build the best Linux experience together! 🚀
