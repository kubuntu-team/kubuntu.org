There are several other ways to get Kubuntu including torrents, which can potentially mean a quicker download, and links to our regional DVD image mirrors for our older (and newer) releases.

## BitTorrent

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer download network that sometimes enables higher download speeds and more reliable downloads of large files. You will need to install a BitTorrent client, such as [KTorrent](https://apps.kde.org/ktorrent/), on your computer in order to enable this download method.

## Checksums

### SHA256

Before writing an image to DVD or USB drive, it is highly recommended that you verify the SHA256 sum (hash) of the ISO file. For instructions, please see [HowToSHA256SUM](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM). Below is a list of SHA256 sums to check with your downloaded file.

## Past releases

Looking for an older release of Kubuntu? Whether you need an obsolete release or a previous LTS point release with its original stack, you can find them in past releases.
